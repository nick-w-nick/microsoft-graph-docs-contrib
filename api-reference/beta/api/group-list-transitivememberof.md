# List group transitive memberOf

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get groups and administrative units that the group is a member of. This operation is transitive and will also include all groups that this group is a nested member of. Unlike getting a user's Microsoft 365 groups, this returns all types of groups, not just Microsoft 365 groups.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/transitiveMemberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the transitive group members of a group. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 group objects respectively.

Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
